# Welcome to the aguaclara_tutorial wiki!
Here you can find pages with useful resources for Python, Atom, Hydrogen, GitHub, and report writing. All of these tutorials are meant to give you a basic understanding of the tools that AguaClara uses, and how to best use them for your work! These tutorials and trainings will be continuously updated to reflect the skills that team members will need, and any suggested additions, subtractions, and modifications to them can be brought up in this repository's issues.

This repository contains an interactive tutorial covering the basics of Python, Hydrogen, and Markdown. You should clone this repository in order to work on the tutorial.
